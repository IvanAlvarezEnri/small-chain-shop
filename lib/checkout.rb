require 'pricing_rules'

# | This class works as a calculator and scanner.                           |
# | It will scan all the product inside our actual basket                   |
# | It will also reset the basket when needed  and calculate the total      |
# | We can have multiple RulePricing created and change it whenever we want |
# | For example if we want Summer discounts, we can create a price rule     |
# | and changed it only for Summer, then have another price rule to the rest|
# | of the year                                                             |
